### Experience

At the end of each session, we'll answer the following questions for each character, adding 200xp for each one answered positively. Before level 4, each question may be counted only once, a maximum of 800xp per session. Thereafter, each question can be counted twice, a maximum of 1600xp per sessiom.

* **Goals**: Did you acheive one of the group's or your own stated goals?
* **Heritage**: Did you express a unique aspect of your Class, Race, or Background?
* **Motivation**: Did you express your Alignment in a way that made things more difficult for you?
* **Themes**: Did you discover something long lost or overcome terrible danger?

### Episodic Play

Taking influence from the West Marches style of campaign play, every individual session will begin and end in the same location (probably the party's airship?). A running list of potential goals will be maintained between sessions, and one of those goals will be selected by the players before each session.

We may need to make certain adjustments based on group size. For example, combats may not be much fun if there are too many players present, so then we'd try to skew toward an exploration, stealth, intrigue, etc. We'll feel this out as we go!
