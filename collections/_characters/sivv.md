### Location: Owl Isle
Somewhere amongst the islands filled with technological marvels, magical entities and omnipotent gods floats the small Owl Isle. Its surface is filled with ferns, tall grasses and birch trees, fed by a seemingly bottomless lake, which flows of the edges of the island through several small streams and creeks. Small rodents, swallows and the occasional deer feed of the lands. What about the owls? Strangely enough, whenever they fly into the In-between they carelessly soar off, not scared of what lies beyond. They come and go, just like the eclipses.

This has made them an idol to the local populous of goblins, who have yet to embark to the islands that pass in the distance. Many birch trees have parts of their barked stripped off, and feature intricate sculptures and engravings depicting the birds. The goblins live in small but well-constructed wooden cabins in villages on the islands edge.

The goblins have never desired to leave, their isle offers them all they need, and unlike other races they do not perceive the dreaded orange and remain unaffected by the craze it caused. Some trade with the other islands does happen.
Due to this they have yet to harness the powers of the soul garnets and it’s magic, as a side effect, their hunger for progression and power is subdued, leading them to become a near pacifist people, only striking when attacked. Any magic present is used to heal, or chase prey. 
They rely on more practically engineered contraptions. Particularly of interest are their small sling-ships. These light wooden vessels mimic the wings of owls, allowing them to be slung into the air by a trebuchet, to then soar on the currents around for hours on end, often attached to the isle by rope in case the winds suddenly change. 

The primary religion on the island is the worship of the great Hoot, or Feather-Father.
Said to be the first owl to ever leave the island, the Feather-Father flew off into the sky and soared around for weeks. Over time his hunger grew, but as there was no land he could not hunt for a meal.
The owl decided that those little circles in the skies, stars, looked like an appetizing snack.
And thus Hoot flew into the skies and ate all the stars. As he did, he grew ever so slightly after every star, until he was as big as the sun itself.

The goblins believe that the air currents are made by the Feather-Fathers wings, and thunder his majestic hoots. Most villages appoint the captain of a fishing vessel as a priest to the Feather-Father.

Most visitors on the island belief it’s just drunken talk from retired goblin fisherman.

### Character: Sivv, son of Grunn
Aboard the crew of one of these ships is Siv, an older goblin who’s spend most of his life harpooning small sky fishes together with his mates, providing the town with foods, whale/fish oil for lanterns and bones to be crafted into weaponry.

Siv grew up together with two siblings, raised by his single parent, his father Grunn. His mother had tumbled off into the in-between after a sling ship malfunctioned and detached from its tether to the island. As one can imagine, the Owl Isle lacked a schooling system. This meant that once Siv become strong enough to hold a harpoon he’d join his father on the sling ships to learn sky-fishing.

Timed flew by, and Siv quickly became a renown fisher, eventually saving up enough money to buy his own small ship and a four-man crew to man it. With this he attracted the interest of Flung, a female goblin working as seamstress. After two years of dating and such, the two married, and have two sons, Tox and Grunk. 

These two lads took over most of the work on Sivv’s ship, now semi-retired he started spending more time exploring the lovely island, and praying to the Feather-Father. 
One day whilst going for a brief walk the world before him became black, and weird visions started flashing before his eyes for a dozen seconds until he came to.
Over the next year these visions slowly became clearer, showing a technological metropolis, three moons and dark silhouettes being drawn into the sun.

Fearing these visions signal a threat to his family and people, granted to him by the Feather-Father, Sivv bought passage on a merchant vessel to set off and find the meaning behind all of this, and how to keep his people save.

### Goals:
#### Short term/minor:
Try foods from the other islands, obtain metal weaponry (less common on Owl Isle) preferably a rapier/short sword, and a heavy crossbow

#### Long term:
Eventually bring back new technologies to cause less goblins to die from failing sling ships, i.e. learn how other cultures create boats/a general technological interest.

Find the technological metropolis in his visions, and clear up the meaning of the latter two images.

### Personality:
Siv is somewhat laidback, mainly due to his previously calm life on Owl Isle. Due to this however, he is very keen on trying new things, and will hardly oppose doing so, even if this means he puts himself at slight risk.

Being somewhat older he tries to console others, and tries to keep the party together and on speaking terms. Whilst he attempts to sound wise with age, he isn’t.

He tries his best to follow the pacifist nature of his people, and is unlikely to murder others unless severely threatened, instead opting for non-lethal options on letting others do the dirty work.

### Appearance: 
Olive colored grizzly goblin man with light teal freckles and a fuzzy curly beard and a warm, but toothy grin. For a goblin he is relatively tall, and somewhat scrawny.

Instead of spiky iron shoulder pauldrons, Siv has shark jaws strapped to his shoulders, and instead of jacket with fur lining he has one lined with owl feathers. The outside of it is padded with leather wrapped birch wood. Under this he is wearing a simple knitted sweater. He's barefoot at all times.

His ears are pierced with a few iron rings, part of his left ear is missing.

He's wearing a beanie that attempts to tame a wild mane of black-grey hair.

### Fighting style: 
Siv is fast and agile and uses this to manoeuvre across the battlefield to attack enemies that threaten his party, rather than chasing others on his own.

Whilst he carries a large hammer, this is purely meant for construction.
Most of time he uses his trusty harpoon gun (light crossbow) to poke down enemies his allies are fighting with, but if things get heated he’ll charge in with his shield and blasts enemies away with his thunderous magic.

### Magic:
Sivv uses and amulet of a tiny brass owl as his spell focus. Most of his spells (visually) involve wind, thunder or feathers.
