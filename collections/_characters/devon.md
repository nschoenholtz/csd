## {{ page.title }}

Devon is a follower of one of the Lithics that is lesser known, probably due more to their cryptic communication than due to any lacking power. He doesn't always understand why the being wants him to do the things he does, but carries out it's will nonetheless. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this deities requests are often secretive and illicit.
