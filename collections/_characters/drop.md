## {{ page.title }}

The first thing Sky remembers is plummeting from high in the air. As far as she can recalls she's always been alone in the city of Anyuk, having to fend for herself any way she could, often doing odd jobs for shifty people. During one of these, she met an excommunicated-monk from the Ministry of Light. They became quite frequent partners and he taught her how to defend herself more effectively with martial arts.


She’s unsure if what she remembers about falling is real or not but always believed it to be a sign of her purpose in the world. She discovered abseiling through taking a dungeoneering job listed in a tavern. She prefers these sorts of jobs to earn her keep, finding any treasure to trade and sell. She became an extreme outdoor thrillseeker in her free time. She would abseil off the edge of her floating island home and stare into the vast cloudstreams of the sky sea and freerun over derelict buildings around the city. The views are always incredible. She wants to explore the world from different vantage points.


She is carefree and curious, eager to see the whole world and push her limits.She’s more interested in curious objects with stories to tell than money.
