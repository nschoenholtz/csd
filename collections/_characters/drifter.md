## {{ page.title }}

Arrived alone on the island on a drifting boat.

Background: Came from a civilization which stopped breeding because of impending doom from the continent drifing out toward a dark zone, and apocalyptic cryptic dreams of the world ending. He instead left the island alone when turning 30 after having lived for the first few years in "the dark".

Human, male, rather quiet, a jack-of-all-trades, capable of doing most things relatively well -- especially surviving. Not good at social skills.

Goal: Obsessed with the end of the world dream. Obsessed with questions of death, determinism, inevitability of fate, sense vs nihilism. His goal is to uncover what's behind "the dream".

Personality: Rather quiet person, is much better at acting (because of the need to do so to survive) and discussing deep subjects (because of having had a long time alone to think).
