## Jazirat

Jazirat is one of the most famed and technologically advanced of the islands. The largest city on the island (and perhaps in the world) is called Aynuk. Aynuk's most striking feature is the massively tall stone lighthouse at its center, which is what allows airships to reliably locate the island despite the unpredictable nature of air travel.
