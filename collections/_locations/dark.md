## {{page.title}}

Although the majority have returned to the light of the Sun, the people of the world generally refer to their lost islands as The Dark. When an island is caught beneath the dark of a moon for too long it becomes impossible to maintain even the most advanced civilization -- plants die out, then animals that can't flee, and some say monsters rise up to finish the job.

After a time, these islands usually drift back into the light, and if rediscovered may contain a wealth of lost knowledge or valuables left behind in the rush to flee the darkness. Some islands reappear quickly enough to be resettled by the survivors, while others return centuries later, overgrown by jungle and the mysterious of their former civilizations buried deep within.

Many airship missions hope to find an untapped island from The Dark... and that any hazards from the Darkness have moved on.
