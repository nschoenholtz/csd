## {{page.title}}

Though Jazirat may be the single most populous island, the vast majority of the sentient creatures of the world are spread among countless other islands. Some are small and humble, others nearly rival Aynuk. There's a great deal of diversity in culture, technology, biosphere and etc that can lead to excellent opportunities for trade.

Some airship missions set out with holds full of goods, seeking to find a "normal" island with which to trade them for new treasures to bring back to Aynuk. While less risky than expeditions into the Dark, there are still many risks -- even with a "good map" and a solid report, sometimes islands simply are not where you hope to find them. Nonetheless, sometimes a happy mistake can prove to be more valuable than the original plan, and gains are often worthwhile despite the risks.
