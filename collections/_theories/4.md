Maps of the fog, currents, and islands exist. They are all fake. All mapmakers are charlatans and frauds. [Gavin's] character is one of those mapmakers. 90 day warranty offered -- no returns given is the aim. Monetary and stay out of angry customer's way is the goal. Con artist, reluctant to travel knowing the maps are bullshit.
