The Sun is static. Day and night only by lunar eclipse. Daylight is much longer, when eclipses happen is celebratory, with festivals. Moon speed varies, festivities sudden and unpredictable. Static sun is used to travel -- helps to get rough bearings. Sun has distinguishable features. One moon's eclipse is universally celebrated, but the other increases the psychological effects of the color orange and so can be much more dangerous. Cult people are trying to reach the sun using their visions to get there, by reverse engineering what they see. Sun being static is a big influence on civilizations as they drift and spend generations in _darkness_ -- some choose to leave entirely. The sun is not a sphere, it's a natural crescent.
