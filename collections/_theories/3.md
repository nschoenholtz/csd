Orange objects cause people to steal them. They have a corrupting effect. The moral is that you can not steal them back and forth (no take backs), but it's sort of ok to steal orange. Orange garnet is the currency of the world. One island perceives orange as purple (so they steal purple instead). "HIDE THE AUBERGINES". There's a cult who wants to steal the sun. There are very few orange objects around. Colorblind people are outcast. Very dangerous people carry orange as a sort of challenge.
