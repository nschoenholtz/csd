## {{page.title}}

Tecla Moreu is the cunning matriarch of the Moreu trading family, which has risen to power in Jazirat recently on the strength of an unusually high success rate in airship expeditions. She maintains close ties with the Ministry, so some attribute the success to her piety, while others suggest she benefits from some kind of corruption. Competitors often say it's simply a run of good luck.

Tecla is tall and tanned, still in good shape from her days manning the family's first airship. On your signing day, she simply stamped each contract without a word, you and every other desperate adventurer filing past and up the wooden ramp onto the airship.
