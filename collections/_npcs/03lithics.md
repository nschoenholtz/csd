## {{page.title}}

The Lithics are a group of techno-magical floating monoliths, who rule over the various areas of the world. As islands float in and out of their domains, they inevitably communicate with the people living there, offering knowledge and seeking to exert their will on the world. Their communications and goals are often cryptic, and they often come into conflict with one another. Some seem to be better at communicating clearly and/or more generous, and so peoples under their influence often have access to more helpful knowledge which often leads to technological breakthroughs. Some do not believe the Lithics are gods, but their power in the world is undeniable and they are worshipped widely
