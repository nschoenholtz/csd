## {{page.title}}

The party rescued Ugen Susa from the caves beneath Luxor. He's a researcher that had been sent by the Church of the Unseen with his colleagues to explore those caves in search of, presumably, religiously or technologically significant findings.

He was in shock for quite a while after his rescue, but has begun to open up about having seen more metallic creatures deeper in the cave system.
