The Feather-Father , also known as the Bringer of Stars and the Great Hoot, was a god of air, sunshine and eventually storms after the rise of Lithics and other gods.
He favored those who made an effort to move forward after tragedies and bring new hope and change to their communities, as well as those who travelled far for selfless reasons.

### History and Aspects
Itâ€™s said that before the age of men, when only monsters and beasts roamed the lands, the Feather-Father was nothing but a regular owl. It was only after mankind drilled deep into their islands and locked the world into a terrible faith, that the Feather-Father soared into the skies, trying to find a new place to live for those he deemed good.

Alas, the owl could not fly far enough into space, and grew hungry. First he ate a meteor, this fed him for a day. Then, he ate a star, this fed him for a week, and as months and years flew by the Feather-Father had consumed the skies.
Embarrassed by his actions, he decided to stay around this world and aid those on it.
Sailors who could not navigate using the stars were instead granted guidance and favorable winds. Travellers lost in clouds of rain would be offered sunshine and clarity.

He ultimately desires to give back what he has taken.

### Followers
A large following of kenku and goblinoids exists on the Owl, Lament and Dawn isles.
Some humans and elves on the Archipelago of Chains worship the Feather-Father as part of their polytheistic religion. Some traders on the Seas of Aykad carve symbols of the Feather-Father in their vessels as a token of luck, but noone there truly worships him as a god.

Most followers show their devotion by following the ideas of the Feather-Father, and seek to guide and offer clarity to others in times of desperation.

### Home
The Feather-Father is rumored to reside in the skies above the Isle of Dawn, where he watches the world below from behind the clouds.
Some believe if you fly far enough beyond the clouds, you cross into a demi-plane build by the Great Hoot, where he has constructed a grand palace, a safe-haven to those truly lost.
