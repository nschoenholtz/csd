## {{page.title}}

Heaven's Grasp is a secretive group of conspiracy theorists and thieves who believe that they can use reverse-engineered technology they've obtained from visions of other cultures to travel to and take the power of the Sun for themselves. Some believe they have been driven mad by the corrupting influence of possessing too much stolen orange loot, but their operations are very well organized.
