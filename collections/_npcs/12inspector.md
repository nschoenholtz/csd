Wit, as he insists you call him, is not always a welcome presence onboard the airship. As the representative of the Gold Coast Insurance conglomerate he's in many ways the worse cop to Captain Antarsena's bad cop. Once you get a couple of drinks into him though, he'll go on and on about the duty of each sentient being to pursue the most freedom possible for the most sentient beings with maximum efficiency... continuing long after everyone else has left or fallen asleep where they sat. Just don't let him catch you skipping safety checks or maintenance in the morning.
