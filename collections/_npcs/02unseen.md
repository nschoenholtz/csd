## {{page.title}}

The Unseen is a powerful, incorporeal being who rules over the world. They are widely respected if not worshipped, and the official Church of the Unseen is perhaps the most powerful and pervasive organization in the world. The Unseen communicates only though animal messengers, which sometimes deliver cryptic messages that require interpretation by the Oracles of the Church.
