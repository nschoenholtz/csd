### Part 1

Our heroes made preparations in Aynuk before reboarding the flagship to begin their assault. After crashing the ship through the outer wall of the lab, they descended into the sub-basement while the robots kept the guards occupied.

Dr. Steiner and Mordecai were already below, having infiltrated via different means earlier... and with different results. Mordecai was confronted by a suspicious guard once the ship arrived, but soon convinced the guard to mind his own business and made his way to the lowest basement to help Steiner. 

Steiner had just managed to free herself from the cage she'd been rudely confined to by "knocking out" a guard who came too close, and began freeing other prisoners. One calm-seeming humanoid stepped out wordlessly and did not respond to anything she said, while another agreed to leave them alone and make his escape.

Mordecai somehow missed the presence of anything of value in the main office, including any sniveling old scientists who may or may not have been hiding under their desks. Unfortunately, said scientist commanded the previously calm humanoid to fight, and they split into 3 before engaging with Steiner and Mordecai in a tough match.

Stitch and the rest of the crew confronted the creature who Steiner had freed and did not allow it to escape. Then they rejoined Mordecai and Steiner below and helped them deal with the mirror-monks. Mordecai had easily dispatched the head scientist, so is that the end of the lab??

### Part 2

<Narrator voice> It was not, in fact, the end of the lab...
