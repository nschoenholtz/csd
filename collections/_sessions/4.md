## {{page.title}}

The party was sent back to the ruins of Rohesia to try to learn more about the undead threat. After some sick aerial tricks and mountain views, the party began to investigate the ruins of the town only to be lured away by the headstrong warrior Jack's pursuit of a mighty wolfpack.

Working together to take down the giant Alpha matriarch and patriarch of the pack, the party lost track of Samuel. Alone and single-mindedly following his obsession with the enchanted stone key from the caves beneath Luxor, he found himself opening the way to a strange mirrored world, nearly identical to the Rohesia he'd left but perfectly preserved and completely empty.

Zooming out as the first part of the episode drew to a close, we saw the tower of Devon's visions some distance away from the town.

### Rumors
* The ruins of Rohesia are busy at the moment...
* The city of Quelimane in the periphery has a bad shortage of grain.
* The party has rescued or identified all of the Unseen researchers that had been lost beneath Luxor, and recovered a large stone key that had been entombed there.
* A shipment expected from the mining town of Babis in the Periphery has still not arrived in Ayluk after several weeks.

### General options:
* Expedition into [The Dark]({{ '/locations/dark.html' | relative_url }}).
  * What rumours have you heard about your destination?
* City mission in [Aynuk]({{ '/locations/jazirat.html' | relative_url }}).
  * Intrigue/diplomacy, stealth, or intimidation?
* Trade mission to [The Periphery]({{ '/locations/periphery.html' | relative_url }}).
  * What kind of goods are you transporting? What's the place you're trying to get to, and what makes you think you know where it is?
* Discovery: A new discovery session is always an option, for example to define a new region.
  * What are we most excited to learn about?
* Downtime: If people want to allow the passage of time and have their characters pursuing some downtime activities (like researching something, training, building things, etc). This combines well with Discovery or Bottle eps to fill up a shorter session.
  * What are you trying to accomplish? How long do you think it wil take?
* Bottle episode: Roleplay-focused episodes are welcome for nights when the group is in the mood for it. Shipboard hijinks, hometown visits, whatever.
  * Where are you? Who is with you? What's everyone excited/concerned about?
* Hero smash: If the group is having a night (...or week) where they want less thinking and more heroic smashing, we can always create a combat-focused mission.
  * No question, just smash.
