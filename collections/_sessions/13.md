### Part 1

The First Light nearly crashed when its lithic engine failed after passing into the region around High Nest. Our heroes managed to get the ship turned around and then repair the engine, Devon shrinking the runic core to a manageable size so that Jack and the others could get it into position to resume synchronisation.

With that crisis averted, the crew glided down to the town on goblin skiffs. They learned that the problems with magic began around the time when an expedition from the Unseen arrived. Tracking them through the forest, where the plant and animal life seemed to be thriving more than usual, the party was accosted by bandits. The bandits were unprepared for the savagery of Jack and new crewmate Elthing, and quickly were decimated despite some setbacks due to the strange behaviour of magic.

Jack reanimated one of the fallen bandits to carry Stitch, whose magically animated cyborg limbs were failing to operate. They convinced one bandit who'd been spared to lead them to the caves where the Unseen had sent their expedition. Inside they found a massacred group of Unseen... and an open portal.
