### Part 1

The party approached the Eternal City on Iraret's skeleton ship, and Delthea performed the ritual to allow them to project their spirits and travel into the city appearing as if they were ghosts.

When the ritual took effect, our heroes began to awaken as if in a dream, and saw each other somewhat differently:

* Luna: Looks like Morticia in colors of purple and blue, with a black tea and sage scent.
* Drop: Younger cat kid, in her normal disguise but slightly oversized, golden, smelling like cinnamon
* Elthing: Panther with a pirate hat, smelling of blood and sweat
* Steiner: 2 arms, younger, "I would be a QUEEN" Galadriel, 30s, no spikes, armed with a rapier, smells like Werther's Originals
* Mordecai: H. H. Honeybee (slain member of Heaven's Grasp), smells like a dusty potato sack
* Finn: vine covered ghost-skeleton that smells like fresh linen
