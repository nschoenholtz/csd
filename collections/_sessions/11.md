### Part 1

The party split up into two groups to chase down leads. Jack, Devon, and Dr. Steiner staked out the Lithic cult who'd captured Friends of Johnnie in the raid, also seeking building plans from the Freemasons. Meanwhile, Drop, Finn, Mordecai, and Stitch sought after the missing ring from Drop's mother.

Devon was able to identify that the cult's symbol is similar to one of the most popular in Aynuk, the gear icon of Jid. Their icon differs however, with an eye in the center of the gear, a symbol unknown to Devon despite his wide knowledge of Lithic iconography.

Dr. Steiner attempted to bluff her way into the Freemasons Guildhall, while Jack snuck around disguised as a dog. The good Doctor talked herself into a tour, while Jack got himself locked in the kitchen pantry. Devon then arrived a bit late and charmed his way directly do the hall of records to search for the building plans. Dr. Steiner then tried to bluff and brute force her way in, while Jack transformed into a dust cloud and floated up the servants' stairwell to burst through the back door into the hall in full centaur splendor at the same moment.

Across town, the spot where Drop's mentor first found her is now a dark alleyway beside a boarded-up old church. The team's posh disguises raised a few eyebrows, until they rolled around in the filth to blend in. Finn's dowsing from there came up empty unfortunately, so they went to the dry cleaners to spiff up the costumes and try their second bet: the Lighthouse. For better or for worse they located the ring this time... somewhere in the Lighthouse itself, high above. Mordecai helped them obtain paladin disguises and they prepared to infiltrate the Ministry.

### Part 2

The Stakeout Crew obtained a whole bunch of plans from the Freemasons' archive, definitely including the one for the mysterious Lithic cult's headquarters, and managed to escape unnoticed. Just kidding, they raised every alarm the Freemasons ever imagined.

The Infiltration Crew bluffed their way high above to the antechamber of the Archbishop's quarters, and then convinced the real Sentinels who were escorting them that they were having a Toilet Emergency. Succeeding in that distinguished ruse, they then snuck out the window to try to climb the rest of the way to the top. They were nearly spotted by a patrol far below, but Finn dropped his faithful Fae warhorse 700' or so to create a gruesome distraction. A WARHORSE NEVER FORGETS. FINN. -_-

### Part 3

The Stakeout Crew used the blueprints from the old bank that the hostile Lithic cult has occupied to devise a plan to dig their way in through a structural defect in the foundation from an adjoining structure that's been cleared out.

The Infiltration Crew manager to re-enter the Lighthouse, guided by Drop's vague recognition of a chant. They found rows of chanting monks, monitored by a strict teacher. All were blindfolded and intensely focused on the loud, low chanting, so our heroes moved among them undetected. Drop and Finn stepped toward the curved inner wall, but Stitch could not ignore the plight of the monks who were treated as slaves according to the Mento. He connected with a young monk, talking about the exploitation in his past. At the same time, Finn and Drop rotated the screen around the curved inner wall, bathing the room in the warm glow of sunlight... and raising shouts of alarm from around the tower.
