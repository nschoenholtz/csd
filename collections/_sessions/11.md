### Part 1

The party split up into two groups to chase down leads. Jack, Devon, and Dr. Steiner staked out the Lithic cult who'd captured Friends of Johnnie in the raid, also seeking building plans from the Freemasons. Meanwhile, Drop, Finn, and Stitch sought after the missing ring from Drop's mother.

Devon was able to identify that the cult's symbol is similar to one of the most popular in Aynuk, the gear icon of Jid. Their icon differs however, with an eye in the center of the gear, a symbol unknown to Devon despite his wide knowledge of Lithic iconography.

Dr. Steiner attempted to bluff her way into the Freemasons Guildhall, while Jack snuck around disguised as a dog. The good Doctor talked herself into a tour, while Jack got himself locked in the kitchen pantry. Devon then arrived a bit late and charmed his way directly do the hall of records to search for the building plans. Dr. Steiner then tried to bluff and brute force her way in, while Jack transformed into a dust cloud and floated up the servants' stairwell to burst through the back door into the hall in full centaur splendor at the same moment.

Across town, the spot where Drop's mentor first found her is now a dark alleyway beside a boarded-up old church. The team's posh disguises raised a few eyebrows, until they rolled around in the filth to blend in. Finn's dowsing from there came up empty unfortunately, so they went to the dry cleaners to spiff up the costumes and try their second bet: the Lighthouse. For better or for worse they located the ring this time... somewhere in the Lighthouse itself, high above. Mordecai helped them obtain paladin disguises and they prepared to infiltrate the Ministry.
