### Part 1

Our heroes meet with the representative of the Kiwa family at their dockyard house and agreed to travel to Babis to find and rescue the heir, Kemba.

Enroute, Stitch started a fight club among the crew. He failed to convince the kittens to join, but did face the First Mate in the championship round. Sako was angry that he threw the fight, and she said he'd better bring it next time.

They sailed past the floating wreckage of the Lithic warship they'd once boarded, and battled a group of floating constructs before docking at Babis.

### Part 2

They made short work of the constructs awaiting them on the docks, grappling and dragging them all of the dock to plummet to their doom.

Seeing a strange flash of light, they made their way through the wreckage of Babis to the central Temple, where they found a strange elf from another world.

Though relations were tense at first, an attack from more constructs made for uneasy allies.

### Part 3

Agreeing to work together for the best chance at survival in this warzone, Aeren joined with the other heroes to search for signs of Kemba Kiwa. Elthing conducted a strange ritual to find a bearing on the nearest green heron emblem of House Kiwa.

Elthing led the heroes stealthily across town toward the forested hills rising away from town toward the island's central peak. As they neared the edge of town, a fight between rival constructs spilled out from a nearby building. Finn tried to separate the constructs and identify them, but the others sprang into the fray.

Luna filled the building with flames and then examined the construct shells after the other heroes helped finish them off. One group had intricate, curving runes whereas the other's were angular and regimented. Finn didn't recognize them, but could tell neither belonged to his patron. 

As the dust settled from their battle, a dark airship swooped overhead, releasing discs like those used to board the First Light in their first trip to Babis, and seemingly human shouts of warning arose from deeper in the woods.

### Part 4

The party split into two groups on their approach to the hills, with Mordecai and Aeren sneaking off into the woods and others following the path. At one point, as the path wound around a steep hill, they were confronted by human sentries, asking them, "Thoth or Astarti?"

They explained they were with neither and surrendered their weapons to robots who seemed to be working with these humans.

While the robots escorted them up the path, Aeren and Mordecai approached the sentries stealthily. Though Luna cautioned against it, they seized the opportunity for surprise and attacked. Magical darkness shrouded their initial assault, and Aeren dispatched one while Mordecai dragged another into the air and intimidated her into cooperation.

The others heard yells and seized the opportunity to seize their weapons and fight their way free. Uh, probbbbbably, that's where we paused ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜‚
