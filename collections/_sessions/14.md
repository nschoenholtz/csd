## {{page.title}}

When our heroes returned to the city, they heard that two young Tabaxi were being searched out by the Ministry in addition to Drop. Two monks, Riri and Bey, had fled the Lighthouse using the feather token Stitch gave them.

Meeting a new adventurer, a striking purple and blue Tiefling named [OH GOD I FORGET], they met with Drop's old mentor for tips and searched around town until they found them hiding with other orphans in an abandoned house not far from the fish market.
