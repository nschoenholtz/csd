### Part 1

Our heroes set out for Babis, a mining colony that hasn't been heard from in months. After stocking up on supplies and planning out responsibilities, they set out toward the last reported location of Babis.

* Navigator: Mordecai
* Cartographer: Sivv
* Sergeant: Drop From Sky
* Quartermaster: Jack
* Scout: H'trad

The first couple of days went smoothly, and Sivv and Jack even managed some sky-fishing. Three days into the expedition, they battled with a flock of hungry Pterosaur. On the fourth day, they saw signs of another airship nearby but did not locate it. They did, however, crack the case of the missing cheese. Drop followed the scent and found a pair of ratfolk children who'd stowed away in the bilge. She got them to agree to help out, washing dishes in the kitchen to help out Chef Jack. 

On the fifth day, they were surprise attacked by metal men who crashed onto the deck aboard a metal disc, dropped from a metal airship high above. They managed to defeat a few of the creatures before Mordecai tilted the ship, sending the last couple overboard with an assist from Jack.

Miraculously, they managed not lose a single crewmember, with Drop catching one injured crewman who nearly fell overboard after being revived by Sivv. Furthermore, as they recovered from the fight they spotted an island in the distance. Is it Babis? If so, what happened there? Find out next time in Part 2!

### Part 2

Most of our heroes jumped onto the metal platform the attackers has ridden down to their ship as it floated back up to the airship above. Mordecai stayed behind with the First Light to follow the advance boarding party.

Above decks were quiet, but they found inactive statue-men in a cabin to the rear, and a massive chamber full of them below deck. As they descended the huge stairwell, a pair of metallic humanoid creatures floated toward them. A small bird flew into Drifter's shoulder and the Lithic master of the ship communicated with him.

They'd been attacked because the influence of an opposing Lithic had been detected on their ship, and they'd flown into an active warzone. Babis has been mostly destroyed as the two Lithics clash.

As Drifter negotiated with the being and began to decipher it's intentions, it detected that Devon was the one serving an opposing Lithic. 

Before anyone could react, he flung the bird at the nearest floating construct and fled back up the stairs, leaving a cloud of daggers behind to prevent pursuit.

The team sprung into action, Jack and Sivv leaping to grapple one while Drifter and Coal attacked the other as it made after Devon.

Above, Mordecai had been setting a plan in motion to use the First Light to drag the inactive creatures overboard before they could respond.

Below, Lorenzo snuck across the hold toward a door at the front. He was unable to trigger the opening mechanism, but drew the attention of the mechanical-tentacled creature on the other side. Luckily, he was still invisible, and able to slip behind the beast as it searched out into the hold trying to find him.

While the First Light pulled enemies overboard above deck, and the group finished off the two tough floating enemies, and Devon flung himself overboard, shrunk himself, and flung himself aboard the First Light, Lorenzo called upon his knack for breaking things and fiddled with the control unit the tentacled creature had been using until the runic lights that'd been pulsing thoroughout the ship began to go haywire.

The bluish lights began to change color and lose their pattern, a change that slowly spread out from the control room across the hold. As the colours overtook the tentacled creature, it began to go haywore, lurching toward nearby robots and crates and tearing them apart.

Will the group face this strange creature or make an escape? How do they feel about throwing in their lot unintentionally with Devon's mysterious patron?

### Part 3

The team repaired the enemy ship and defeated the tentacled captain, severing all 8 tentacles and bringing the disabled core back to the First light for study.

### Rumors

### General options:
* Expedition into [The Dark]({{ '/locations/dark.html' | relative_url }}).

* City mission in [Aynuk]({{ '/locations/jazirat.html' | relative_url }}).
  * Intrigue/diplomacy, stealth, or intimidation?
* Trade mission to [The Periphery]({{ '/locations/periphery.html' | relative_url }}).
  * What kind of goods are you transporting? What's the place you're trying to get to, and what makes you think you know where it is?
* Discovery: A new discovery session is always an option, for example to define a new region.
  * What are we most excited to learn about?
* Downtime: If people want to allow the passage of time and have their characters pursuing some downtime activities (like researching something, training, building things, etc). This combines well with Discovery or Bottle eps to fill up a shorter session.
  * What are you trying to accomplish? How long do you think it wil take?
* Bottle episode: Roleplay-focused episodes are welcome for nights when the group is in the mood for it. Shipboard hijinks, hometown visits, whatever.
  * Where are you? Who is with you? What's everyone excited/concerned about?
* Hero smash: If the group is having a night (...or week) where they want less thinking and more heroic smashing, we can always create a combat-focused mission.
  * No question, just smash.
