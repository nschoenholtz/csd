### Part 1

Another new crewmate named Stitch has signed on with the First Light, a goblin pit fighter whose body has been torn apart and rebuilt with magical technology. Stitch convinced a group to join him on one last quick money making jaunt to the fighting pits on the night before they set out for their next voyage.

The intrepid adventurers made their way to the Red Circus, hidden in a warehouse in the Aynuk dockyards, where the enigmatic crime boss Delightful Tooth has contracted Stitch to win his way to the final round of the night's tournament before taking a fall.

In disguise, our heroes became Team Cannibal Priest:

* Professor Zebraman (Jack)
* Puss n Boots (Drop)
* Gondorf the Black (Finn)
* Bob the Robot (Mordecai)
* Stitch (as himself)

Along with Devon manipulating events from the crowd.

In the first round, they faced off against the incomprehensible warriors of McRock, whose black leather and longswords were not much of an obstacle.

Then they watched while Jim and the Crazy Humans faced off against Super Delightful Mice, who took down the Crazy Humans but then fell before the cold savagery of JIM.

In the last match of the first round, Ross's Midnight Plumbers crushed the wizardry of the Red Gonzo Burnouts with brutal efficiency.

In part two, Cannibal Priest must go toe-to-toe with Jim and the Crazy Humans. Can they stand up to the mysterious and deadly black Knight JIM?

## Rumors

### General options:
* Expedition into [The Dark]({{ '/locations/dark.html' | relative_url }}).
  * What rumours have you heard about your destination?
* City mission in [Aynuk]({{ '/locations/jazirat.html' | relative_url }}).
  * Intrigue/diplomacy, stealth, or intimidation?
* Trade mission to [The Periphery]({{ '/locations/periphery.html' | relative_url }}).
  * What kind of goods are you transporting? What's the place you're trying to get to, and what makes you think you know where it is?
* Discovery: A new discovery session is always an option, for example to define a new region.
  * What are we most excited to learn about?
* Downtime: If people want to allow the passage of time and have their characters pursuing some downtime activities (like researching something, training, building things, etc). This combines well with Discovery or Bottle eps to fill up a shorter session.
  * What are you trying to accomplish? How long do you think it wil take?
* Bottle episode: Roleplay-focused episodes are welcome for nights when the group is in the mood for it. Shipboard hijinks, hometown visits, whatever.
  * Where are you? Who is with you? What's everyone excited/concerned about?
* Hero smash: If the group is having a night (...or week) where they want less thinking and more heroic smashing, we can always create a combat-focused mission.
  * No question, just smash.
