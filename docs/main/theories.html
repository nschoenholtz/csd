          <li>
            
              <p>Floating sky island, travel between is expensive creating cultural/class divide. Travel industry is booming. People have visions of people on other isles and believe they happen. Unique deities for areas. All people dream some cryptic Ragnarok dream. Island-edge rock climbing. The islands move, and space-continuum is broken at times.</p>

            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            
              <p>The Sun is static. Day and night only by lunar eclipse. Daylight is much longer, when eclipses happen is celebratory, with festivals. Moon speed varies, festivities sudden and unpredictable. Static sun is used to travel – helps to get rough bearings. Sun has distinguishable features. One moon’s eclipse is universally celebrated, but the other increases the psychological effects of the color orange and so can be much more dangerous. Cult people are trying to reach the sun using their visions to get there, by reverse engineering what they see. Sun being static is a big influence on civilizations as they drift and spend generations in <em>darkness</em> – some choose to leave entirely. The sun is not a sphere, it’s a natural crescent.</p>

            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            
              <p>Orange objects cause people to steal them. They have a corrupting effect. The moral is that you can not steal them back and forth (no take backs), but it’s sort of ok to steal orange. Orange garnet is the currency of the world. One island perceives orange as purple (so they steal purple instead). “HIDE THE AUBERGINES”. There’s a cult who wants to steal the sun. There are very few orange objects around. Colorblind people are outcast. Very dangerous people carry orange as a sort of challenge.</p>

            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            
              <p>Maps of the fog, currents, and islands exist. They are all fake. All mapmakers are charlatans and frauds. [Gavin’s] character is one of those mapmakers. 90 day warranty offered – no returns given is the aim. Monetary and stay out of angry customer’s way is the goal. Con artist, reluctant to travel knowing the maps are bullshit.</p>

            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            
              <p>Magic is powered by human sacrifice – the more accepting of this, more technologically advanced. Magic potency passed on if not harvested through generations. Deities affect this. Technological concepts shared through generations.</p>

            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            
              <p>The world is ruled by a non-corporeal entity that no one has ever seen but communicates through animals. There’s a prominent religion that opposes their rule.</p>

            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            
              <p>Stars are a myth/legend. Detailed legends, but gone. Always summer due to now seasons. Two moons. Group dedicated to finding the stars. Visions about starts – thinks it’s mind stuff. It has become normal.</p>

            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            
              <p>Gods are magical machines. They fight to keep their status by hiding their secret to humans there are doubts they’re actual gods. It’s forbidden to write about gods and religious tradition is only word of mouth. Some people are atheist.</p>

            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            
              <p>Dystopian magepunk setting. Mostly underground practice that is warded against by authority. Mysterious origin.</p>

            
          </li>
        
          <li>
            
              <p>Long-distance travel is considered dangerous and “crazy” as you never know if you’ll find your way back home. Some people live nomadic lifestyles (and usually have no religion). There’s a myth of a monster out there that kills everyone if you go too far, though no one has seen it. Animals don’t have trouble navigating between islands (like bird migration). Magic and tech helps with travel but still super risky. One common capital punishment is exiling people into the sky-sea. People fear (generally) other islands because of mystery and fear of the unknown. Tradition exists for people who leave: smash a mirror, and if you see the person who left in the reflection that means they will come back.</p>
